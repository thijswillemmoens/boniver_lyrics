I\u2019m satisfied)\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nAm I dependent in what I\u2019m defending?\nAnd do we get to hold what faith provides?\nFold your hands into mine\nI did my believing\nSeeing every time\n\n[Outro]\nI know it's lonely in the dark\nAnd this year\u2019s a visitor\nAnd we have to know that faith declines\nI'm not all out of mine3Embed"
